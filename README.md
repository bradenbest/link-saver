# Link Saver by Braden Best

The Link Saver is a project I made to replace bookmarks and provide a clean UI instead. Cause in my opinion, browser bookmark systems suck.

## What's new

* new data model
  * This version saves everything into one localStorage entry
* more stable
* cleans up the UI with a head menu
* adds Search functionality
* adds options menu
