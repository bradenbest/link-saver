# Link Saver by Braden Best

The Link Saver is a project I made to replace bookmarks and provide a clean UI instead. Cause in my opinion, browser bookmark systems suck.

## Version 4

I changed the data model yet again (seems like that was the **only** thing I was improving)

I also re-worked the UI and tried to make the app look respectable

The code in this is somewhat good quality. ~~Though my choice of mashing the external files into one line was questionable at best.~~ Never mind, I put them back into their files like it was before I did that.

Still uses objects instead of arrays because I still didn't know `Array.prototype.splice()` was a thing
