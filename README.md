# Link Saver by Braden Best

The Link Saver is a project I made to replace bookmarks and provide a clean UI instead. Cause in my opinion, browser bookmark systems suck.

## Version 4.1

This version adds php/MySQL database functionality to the app. Though it's a bit clunky, since it just stores a giant json string in one column. Which for some reason is exceedingly difficult to do withohut errors. In my opinion, storing a string in a database and being able to retreive and parse it, should be the most trivial of tasks, not requiring multiple levels of escaping.
