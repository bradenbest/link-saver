# Link Saver by Braden Best

The Link Saver is a project I made to replace bookmarks and provide a clean UI instead. Cause in my opinion, browser bookmark systems suck.

## What's new?

This version adds paradigms. Although I stubbornly kept with the awful storage model from 1.0.0, along with using regex to edit links, and now paradigms.

...It gets better in the next version.

## More awfulness

Remember when I said `Fatal Error` in the README for 1.0.0-master? Go ahead and make a paradigm called "?" and try to remove it. 

Yep.

I think this version is even _more_ unstable than 1.0.0. Microsoft would be proud!
